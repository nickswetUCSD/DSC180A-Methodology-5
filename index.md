## Brainstorming
1. *What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?*
- The most interesting topic we have covered this quarter is a specific flavor of test-time adaptation: continual test-time adaptation (CoTTA). I find CoTTA interesting because CoTTA has very apparent application. CoTTA takes in a stream of ever-changing data in order to adapt a neural network to an ever-changing environment; this is naturally a good fit for solving vision-related problems for autonomous vehicles.

2. *Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.*
- One investigation I would like to pursue for our Quarter 2 project is tweaking the mathematics of CoTTA to produce more efficient results. We have read other papers on test-time adaptation noting how a specific method of pseudolabeling, known as conjugate pseudolabeling, produces lower error rates when applied to neural network training. So, the question is: can we use the mathematics of more efficient conjugate pseudolabeling to improve the performance of CoTTA?

3. *What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?*
- One change I would have liked to make to our Quarter 1 project is tweaking the code more. Sure, our intentions with the Quarter 1 Project were to replicate the results of an experiment in a paper that we read, but after doing so, I'm still left a little lost wondering how exactly the code works. I feel that more tinkering with the code in our Quarter 1 Project could have made me more confident in my knowledge of what what our code does.

4. *What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?*
- Other techniques I would be interested in is experimenting with different datasets to apply our method to. There's no telling if one of the methods we have seen for test-time adaptation versus another will be better at classifying medical data versus environmental data; could certain methods be more efficient at classifying certain datasets?
